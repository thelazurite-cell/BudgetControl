# BudgetControl
A web application for controlling budgeting 
* Angular frontend 
* NodeJS - TypeScript backend 
* MongoDB - For Storage

### Getting started
This demo app has a user of "Administrator" and a password of "foobar" that is created on first launch. 
You will need to modify the configuration of the backend to point to your internal IP, and make sure your env config on the frontend is pointing to it, too.
